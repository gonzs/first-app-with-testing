This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Purpose

    - Set up a simple react app with Jest and Enzyme
    - Used Enzyme's shallow() function to render a component
    - Tested that required DOM elements were rendered using find()
    - Tested state using Enzyme's setState() and state()
    - Used simulate to interact with rendered elements (clicked button)
    - Tested component for updates after interaction
    - Created re-usable setup() and findByTestAttr() functions
